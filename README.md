# TicTacToe
This is my pygame version of Tic Tac Toe.

Player One(X) uses the numbers at the top of the keyboard and presses the corresponding number on the keyboard in order to make their move.

Player Two(O) will then use the keypad to the side and press the corresponding number on the keyboard to draw their circle.

The game continues until someone gets three in a row, thus becoming the winner.

    I used this to find commands to use for my game that I had not yet known from the tutorial that I watched.
